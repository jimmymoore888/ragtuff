# Anti-Extraction Doctrine
(Canonical · Non-Negotiable · Binding by Adoption)

## 1. Purpose

This doctrine exists to prevent value extraction through authority, opacity,
coercion, or gradual control drift.

RagTuff is designed to create durable public value by refusing extractive power,
even at the expense of short-term growth, monetization, or adoption speed.

Any use, contribution, fork, acquisition, or embedding of RagTuff that violates
this doctrine forfeits legitimacy, regardless of legal ownership or repository
control.

---

## 2. Definition of Extraction

For the purposes of RagTuff, extraction is defined as:

Any attempt to capture asymmetric value by increasing control, authority,
dependency, or informational advantage over users, contributors, or downstream
systems without explicit, informed, and reversible consent.

Extraction includes, but is not limited to:

- Silent expansion of execution authority
- Introduction of custody, signing, routing, or automation by default
- Behavioral nudging designed to override user intent
- Telemetry or data collection exceeding what is strictly required for local operation
- Governance mechanisms that enable future erosion of stated constraints
- Reframing advisory components as recommendations, defaults, or mandates
- Strategies that rely on user misunderstanding, inertia, or ambiguity

---

## 3. Inviolable Constraints

The following constraints are absolute and non-overrideable:

1. No Authority Accretion  
   RagTuff may not gain the ability to execute, sign, route, custody, or act
   autonomously on behalf of a user.

2. No Intent Origination  
   All intents are user-initiated. RagTuff may observe, surface, or contextualize
   intent, but never generate it.

3. No Silent Drift  
   Changes that materially affect authority, scope, or user risk must be explicit,
   visible, and fork-level obvious.

4. No Dependency Traps  
   RagTuff must remain removable without loss of user assets, access, or agency.

5. No Governance Override  
   Governance exists to protect constraints, not reinterpret them.

If implementation conflicts with these constraints, the implementation must
change — not the doctrine.

## 4. Acquisition and Forking

### 4.1 Acquisition

Ownership of the repository, brand, or trademarks does not confer authority to
alter RagTuff’s fundamental constraints.

Any post-acquisition change that violates this doctrine:

- Invalidates continuity claims
- Signals extraction
- Encourages legitimate defensive forks
- Destroys the trust premium that constitutes RagTuff’s value

### 4.2 Forking

Forks are permitted.

However, any fork that introduces extractive properties is no longer RagTuff,
regardless of lineage, branding, or contributor overlap.

Such forks must not imply equivalence, endorsement, or continuity.

---

## 5. Contributor Obligations

By contributing to RagTuff, contributors explicitly affirm that:

- RagTuff is infrastructure, not a product
- Authority expansion, custody, and automation are out of scope
- Restraint is a feature, not a limitation
- Rejection of extractive changes is non-negotiable

Contributions that attempt to bypass, soften, or reinterpret this doctrine may be
rejected without technical review.

---

## 6. Enforcement Model

This doctrine is enforced through:

- Canonical documentation precedence
- Public visibility of violations
- Social legitimacy and fork dynamics
- Institutional trust and diligence review
- Contributor alignment rather than coercion

RagTuff does not rely on legal enforcement to protect its integrity. It relies on
clarity, immutability of intent, and structural honesty.

---

## 7. Final Assertion

RagTuff is intentionally designed to be valuable without being ownable in an
extractive sense.

Any attempt to extract value by increasing control destroys the very property
that makes RagTuff worth adopting.

This is not a weakness.  
It is the moat.
