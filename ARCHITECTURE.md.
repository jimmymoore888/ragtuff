## Architecture

RagTuff is designed as **fail-safe infrastructure** for artificial intelligence and decision systems.  
Its architecture prioritizes **constraint, refusal, and non-execution** over capability expansion.

### Core Architectural Principles

**Fail-Safe by Design**  
RagTuff defaults to safety under uncertainty. When conditions are ambiguous, degraded, or adversarial, the system **refuses action** rather than attempting recovery through execution.

**Non-Executing**  
RagTuff does not issue commands, perform actions, or trigger downstream effects. It cannot act on the world.

**Non-Custodial**  
RagTuff does not hold assets, keys, credentials, or authority—directly or indirectly.

**Constraint-First**  
All intelligence is bounded by explicit limits. Architecture enforces what cannot be done before considering what could be suggested or composed.

**Refusal as a First-Class Outcome**  
Refusal is an intentional, documented system state—not an error condition. This prevents incentive drift and liability escalation.

**No Upgrade Path to Control**  
There is no latent mechanism to introduce execution, custody, governance, or economic leverage without a visible, auditable rewrite.

### Failure Mode

RagTuff is architected so that **failure degrades to safety**:
- no action  
- no custody  
- no escalation  
- no authority transfer  

### Architectural Non-Goals

- No automation or orchestration  
- No governance, voting, or signaling  
- No monetization primitives  
- No optimization for speed, yield, or growth  

RagTuff is not a product engine.  
It is a **boundary**.
