# RagTuff

## Canonical Definition

**RagTuff** is a **Strategically, Financially, and Cryptographically Engineered  
Decision-Support Positioning System**  
for **Defensive and Adversarial Analysis, Counter-Improvement Measurement, and Consequence Modeling**.

RagTuff is advisory-only by design. It models, evaluates, and positions decisions under uncertainty and adversarial pressure while preserving full human agency and external execution authority at all times.

---

## What RagTuff Is — and Is Not

### RagTuff Is
- A decision-support and positioning system
- A consequence modeling and scenario evaluation framework
- A defensive and adversarial analysis tool
- A counter-improvement measurement system
- Cryptographically integrity-preserving and audit-oriented
- Non-custodial, client-side, and user-controlled

### RagTuff Is Not
- An execution engine
- A routing or transaction system
- A controller of assets, infrastructure, or networks
- A custodian of funds, keys, or credentials
- An autonomous or self-directing system

RagTuff does not execute actions, issue commands, or assume authority. All decisions and actions remain external to the system.

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Context Awareness (Analytical Only)

RagTuff analyzes user-provided context and environment signals solely to inform modeling and evaluation.

Context awareness is used to:
- Reduce analytical setup friction
- Improve relevance of modeled scenarios
- Position decisions relative to constraints and risk

RagTuff does not act on environments, route actions, or initiate workflows.

---

### 2. Privacy-First by Design

RagTuff never stores funds, private keys, seed phrases, credentials, or signing authority.

- All assets remain under the user’s direct control
- No custody is ever assumed
- Cryptography is used for integrity, verification, and auditability — not control

---

### 3. Scenario Path Evaluation (Not Routing)

Rather than routing actions, RagTuff models and compares potential paths.

This includes:
- Evaluating defensive and adversarial dynamics
- Measuring counter-improvements and adaptive responses
- Comparing downstream consequences across possible decisions

RagTuff presents outcomes and tradeoffs.  
It never selects, executes, or enforces a path.

---

### 4. Counter-Improvement Measurement

RagTuff measures how systems, actors, or adversaries adapt over time.

This allows users to:
- Observe escalation or degradation effects
- Identify false improvements or hidden regressions
- Stress-test decisions against adaptive pressure

Measurement is analytical and observational, not operational.

---

### 5. Consequence Modeling Under Constraint

RagTuff is designed for high-consequence decision environments, where errors are costly and second-order effects matter.

The system emphasizes:
- Explicit assumptions
- Downstream effect visibility
- Ethical, legal, and financial boundary awareness
- Deterministic and auditable reasoning paths

---

## Architectural Posture

- Advisory-only
- Non-executing
- Non-custodial
- Client-side
- Deterministic and auditable
- Explicit refusal of execution authority

---

## Intended Use

RagTuff is intended for:
- Enterprise risk and compliance analysis
- Financial exposure and stress modeling
- Adversarial and defensive scenario evaluation
- Infrastructure and policy decision support

It is not intended for weapons systems, autonomous operations, or active control environments.

---

## Summary

RagTuff exists to answer one question:

**“Where does this decision place me — financially, strategically, legally, and irreversibly?”**

It provides orientation under pressure without ever taking control.
