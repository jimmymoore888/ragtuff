# RagTuff Is Not Crypto

The world is optimized to understand things that:
- promise upside
- offer leverage
- create velocity
- signal power

RagTuff does none of those on the surface.
It does something much rarer and much harder to see.

It removes classes of irreversible harm before they can occur.

That is not immediately legible in a culture trained to ask
“what do I get?” instead of “what breaks if this goes wrong?”

## Language and Audience

RagTuff is not designed to go public.
It is designed to make going public less dangerous.
