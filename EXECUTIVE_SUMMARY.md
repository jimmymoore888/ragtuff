RAGTUFF — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Copyright © 2026 Jimmy W. Moore. All Rights Reserved.

--------------------------------------------------
WHAT RAGTUFF IS
--------------------------------------------------

RagTuff is a proprietary, constraint-first runtime and infrastructure framework designed to operate safely in high-risk, high-compliance environments.

Unlike traditional platforms, RagTuff is built around explicit non-execution, non-custodial, and refusal-based design principles. It is engineered to reduce systemic risk, limit unintended authority, and prevent silent extraction or misuse.

RagTuff is not a feature platform.
It is a control framework.

--------------------------------------------------
THE PROBLEM RAGTUFF SOLVES
--------------------------------------------------

Modern systems fail not because they lack capability, but because they execute when they should not.

Organizations face escalating risk from:
- Over-privileged systems
- Implicit execution authority
- Ambiguous responsibility boundaries
- Audit complexity
- Uncontrolled third-party code
- Regulatory and compliance exposure

RagTuff addresses these risks by enforcing architectural limits by design.

--------------------------------------------------
CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------

- Constraint-first architecture
- Explicit execution boundaries
- Non-custodial operation
- Deterministic behavior
- Refusal surfaces instead of silent failure
- Auditability and governance clarity
- No hidden authority or implicit escalation paths

These principles are embedded structurally, not layered on later.

--------------------------------------------------
WHY RAGTUFF IS DIFFERENT
--------------------------------------------------

RagTuff does not attempt to do more.
It is designed to prevent more.

By narrowing what systems are allowed to do, RagTuff:
- Reduces blast radius
- Simplifies compliance
- Improves audit posture
- Clarifies accountability
- Prevents unauthorized execution

This makes RagTuff suitable for environments where failure is unacceptable.

--------------------------------------------------
LICENSING MODEL
--------------------------------------------------

RagTuff is NOT open source.

Commercial use is not pre-authorized.

All commercial deployment requires:
- Direct negotiation with the owner
- Explicit written authorization
- A signed commercial license agreement

This ensures:
- Controlled deployment
- Clear governance
- Known authority
- Legal certainty

--------------------------------------------------
WHO CONTROLS RAGTUFF
--------------------------------------------------

RagTuff is solely owned and governed by its author, Jimmy W. Moore.

There is a single canonical implementation and authority chain.
No forks, resales, or derivative commercialization are permitted without consent.

--------------------------------------------------
USE CASES
--------------------------------------------------

RagTuff is suitable for:
- Regulated enterprise infrastructure
- Compliance-sensitive systems
- Security-critical runtimes
- Audit-heavy environments
- Organizations seeking risk reduction through architectural restraint

--------------------------------------------------
ENGAGEMENT PATH
--------------------------------------------------

Organizations interested in RagTuff must:
1. Initiate contact with the owner
2. Define intended use and risk profile
3. Negotiate commercial terms
4. Execute a formal license agreement

Unauthorized use is prohibited.

--------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------

RagTuff is infrastructure for organizations that value control, safety, and accountability over unchecked capability.

It is designed to prevent the wrong actions from ever being possible.

Commercial access is available by negotiation only.
