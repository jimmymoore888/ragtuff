RAGTUFF — REMAINING PROTOCOL COMPLETION SEQUENCE
Canonical. Constraint-First. Order-Dependent.

PURPOSE
This document stages the remaining protocols required to move RagTuff from
architecturally proven to institution-ready. These are completion gates, not
features. No capability expansion is permitted by this sequence.

====================================================================
PHASE A — OPERATIONAL FINALIZATION (NO NEW CAPABILITIES)
====================================================================

A1. CANONICAL AUTHORITY ASSERTION
- Declare a single authoritative repository as “RagTuff Canonical”.
- State unambiguously that forks, clones, mirrors, or snapshots are non-authoritative.
- Authority flows from intent and constraint discipline, not duplication.
- This declaration is immutable once published.

A2. EXECUTION REFUSAL SURFACE (FORMALIZATION)
- Enumerate explicit non-goals.
- RagTuff will never execute, decide, enforce, arbitrate, or control outcomes.
- RagTuff will never assume custody, coercive authority, or autonomous agency.
- Refusal is documented as a first-class capability and a safety boundary.

A3. IMMUTABILITY ZONES (FINAL)
- Finalize directories designated as permanently frozen.
- Frozen status is enforced by policy and intent, not tooling.
- Frozen zones are readable but non-modifiable, including by the author,
  except under a formal revision protocol that reasserts authority.
- Expected number of valid unfreeze events: zero.

A4. MOBILE-DEGRADED ENVIRONMENT PROTOCOL
- Codify operation under constrained tooling (mobile, degraded UI) as a requirement.
- Enforce ASCII-only paths for mobile edits.
- Require content-before-commit.
- Designate sanctioned staging surfaces for mobile work.
- Treat mobile operability as evidence of resilience, not convenience.

====================================================================
PHASE B — AUDIT & GOVERNANCE READINESS
====================================================================

B1. AUDIT TRACEABILITY STATEMENT
- Map intent, architecture, and implementation surfaces explicitly.
- State that the absence of execution logic is intentional and auditable.
- Define what auditors should verify and what they should not expect to find.
- Emphasize determinism, refusal boundaries, and non-custodial posture.

B2. CHANGE CONTROL PROTOCOL
- Define “change” versus “clarification”.
- Structural change requires justification beyond convenience.
- Require downstream consequence analysis proportional to risk.
- Reject changes that introduce authority creep or ambiguity.

B3. VERSION MEANING PROTOCOL
- Versions represent constraint maturity, not feature count.
- Prohibit semantic inflation.
- Major version changes require structural or governance significance.
- Minor changes reflect clarification or hardening only.

====================================================================
PHASE C — DUPLICATION & DERIVATIVE CONTROL (LOCKED BUT DEFERRED)
====================================================================

C1. DUPLICATION PRECONDITIONS
- Duplication is prohibited until RagTuff is formally declared complete.
- Any duplication requires an explicit statement of purpose.
- Canonical versus derivative status must be declared at creation time.

C2. DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION
- Define allowed derivative types (snapshot, demo, evaluation).
- Derivatives may not evolve independently.
- Derivatives must reference canonical intent verbatim and visibly.

C3. AUTHORITY NON-TRANSFER CLAUSE
- Duplication does not transfer authorship, authority, or legitimacy.
- Authority remains singular and upstream at all times.

====================================================================
PHASE D — COMPLETION DECLARATION
====================================================================

D1. COMPLETION CRITERIA
- Completion equals constraint saturation, not feature saturation.
- RagTuff is complete when nothing essential can be added without violating intent.

D2. COMPLETION ATTESTATION
- Issue a formal declaration of completion.
- Timestamp and freeze the declaration.
- Post-declaration, RagTuff transitions from expansion to maintenance.

D3. POST-COMPLETION POSTURE
- Permitted actions: maintenance, clarification, protocol-governed duplication.
- Expansion without re-founding is prohibited.
