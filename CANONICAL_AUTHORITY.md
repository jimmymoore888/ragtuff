RAGTUFF — CANONICAL AUTHORITY DECLARATION
Immutable. Constraint-First. Singular Authority.

====================================================================

PURPOSE

This document declares the singular canonical authority for RagTuff.

It exists to prevent ambiguity, authority drift, legitimacy laundering,
and post-hoc claims of authorship or control arising from duplication,
forking, or partial replication.

This declaration is governance, not capability.
It introduces no execution, no control, and no expansion.

====================================================================

CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH

The official RagTuff repository designated by the author is the sole
canonical source of truth for:

- Intent
- Constraints
- Architecture
- Governance
- Protocol definitions
- Completion status

All authority flows from this canonical source only.

Forks, clones, mirrors, snapshots, or derivatives are non-authoritative
by default, regardless of fidelity or completeness.

====================================================================

AUTHORITY MODEL

RagTuff authority is derived from:

- Intent discipline
- Constraint saturation
- Explicit refusal boundaries
- Non-custodial posture
- Absence of execution authority

Authority does NOT derive from:

- Duplication
- Popularity
- Adoption
- Modification
- Hosting location
- Commercial usage
- Third-party endorsement

No downstream artifact may claim legitimacy by resemblance alone.

====================================================================

DUPLICATION AND DERIVATIVES

Duplication does not transfer:

- Authorship
- Governance rights
- Canonical status
- Decision authority
- Interpretive authority

Any derivative must explicitly and visibly declare itself
non-canonical and reference the canonical source verbatim.

Silence on authority is interpreted as non-authoritative.

====================================================================

IMMUTABILITY

This declaration is immutable once published.

It may not be altered, weakened, reinterpreted, or superseded
without explicit re-founding of RagTuff.

Expected number of valid amendments: zero.
